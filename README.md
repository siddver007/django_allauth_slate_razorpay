### Django allauth

### Slate

## HOW TO USE  

1. Clone the project or download the zip.
2. Make a virtual environment( Helps you keep the global system-wide packages  
   and local project-wise packages seperate )
3. Go to settings.py and put your database connection variables. Also add EMAIL_HOST,  
   EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD of the SMTP server you have chosen or simply   
   remove all email variables except EMAIL_BACKEND to show test email in cmd/terminal. 
   Also add your RAZOR_KEY_ID and RAZOR_KEY_SECRET after registering at Razorpay.
4. Now run commands:-  
   a. python manage.py makemigrations registerApp  
   b. python manage.py syncdb  
   c. python manage.py collectstatic  
5. Now run the app by typing in "python manage.py runserver"
6. Go to "localhost:8000" in your web-browser and this is the user registration page.
7. You can login using localhost:8000/login
8. You find other URL-patterns in the urls.py of both project and app.

**NOTE: There might be some issues with the UI Templates and other stuff as well so, you can open an issue on this repository if you want to ask something from me/ need my help.**
